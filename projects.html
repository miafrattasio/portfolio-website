            <h3>Juice Shop Penetration Testing</h3>
            <p>This project focused on a penetration test analysis of the OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately insecure web application used for training and demos on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. The analysis, that I presented to the Brown Brothers Harriman Cyber Working Group, demonstrated real-world exploits using the Burp Suite tool. Key vulnerabilities I exploited included Broken Access Control, Injection, and Vulnerable and Outdated Components. My favorite exploit I completed was a NoSQL Manipulation attack to update multiple product reviews to "Hacked by Mia" simultaneously.</p>

            <h3>UI State Replication: A Zero-Downtime Patching Solution</h3>
            <p>This project addresses the downsides of software patching downtime. The approach, designed to run locally on endpoint devices to avoiding high costs of LLMs, captures user actions and replays them on a newly patched VM in real-time. The program also validates progress and realigns when non-deterministic elements are introduced. This work provides a scalable, privacy-preserving, and accessible solution for enterprise endpoint security updates.</p>

            <h3>Street Heat: Urban Heat Monitoring in Andalusia</h3>
            <p>Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) intensify climate-related challenges in densely populated regions like Andalusia, Spain. This study addresses previous data collection gaps by developing a low-cost, Arduino-based portable device that measures environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. Informed by local surveys and interviews, the device, the mobile app, and its accompanying website enable real-time data visualization of UHIs to promote research collaboration around the world and raise awareness of UHI effects on human health and the environment.</p>

            <h3>Student Assistant (SA) Management System</h3>
            <p>This application allows students to create detailed profiles, listing their academic history and courses they have previously been an SA for. They can then browse and apply for open SA positions. Professors use the platform to post positions for their course sections, setting specific requirements (like minimum GPA), and then review the student applications to make their selections. The system uses Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication. </p>

            <p>This project is a comprehensive professional portfolio serving as a central hub for my academic, professional, and technical assets. The site is organized into clear sections detailing my work history, academic concentrations, technical skill stack, and key projects, like the Clue Solver application. Engineered for high performance, the design utilizes a fully responsive, multi-column CSS Grid layout to ensure an optimal user experience across all devices. The application is implemented as a static site, allowing for low-latency delivery and cost-effective hosting on Google Cloud Storage.</p>

            <h3>Book Collection</h3>
            <p>This project is a full-stack web application designed to allow individual users to manage and track their personal book collections. The core functionality centers on secure, user-specific data management, starting with a combined User Authentication process that handles both registration and login, with username and password pairs stored in a dedicated users collection in MongoDB. Once authenticated, users can perform all standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their book entries. These books are stored in a separate books collection and are explicitly linked to the user via their username, ensuring personalized collections. Additionally, the application provides automatic Reading Status Tracking, dynamically setting a book's status to "Read" if a rating (1-5) is provided by the user, or "Not Read" if the rating field is left empty.</p>

            <h3>Actors and Movies Degrees of Seperation</h3>
            <p>This project implements different calculations of degrees of separation in the film industry, a concept famously associated with the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game. The core functionality involves modeling the relationships between actors and movies as a graph and using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two entities, which represents the degree of separation.</p>
