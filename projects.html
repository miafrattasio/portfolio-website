            <h3>WPIBuys</h3>
            <p>A student-only marketplace for WPI where users can buy, sell, and swap items like textbooks, clothing, and furniture. Students can create personal accounts with encrypted logins, upload profile photos, and manage their own listings and saved posts. The platform makes it easy to browse all items, search by category or price, and upload items with photos and descriptions. Users can edit their posts at any time and chat with sellers or buyers through real-time messaging to coordinate meet-ups on campus.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies and Skills:</strong> Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Gleam, WebSockets, Credential Security</p>

            <h3>Juice Shop Penetration Testing</h3>
            <p>This project focused on a penetration test analysis of the OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately insecure web application used for training and demos on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. The analysis, that I presented to the Brown Brothers Harriman Cyber Working Group, demonstrated real-world exploits using the Burp Suite tool. Key vulnerabilities I exploited included Broken Access Control, Injection, and Vulnerable and Outdated Components. My favorite exploit I completed was a NoSQL Manipulation attack to update multiple product reviews to "Hacked by Mia" simultaneously.</p>
            <p><strong>Tools and Skills:</strong> Burp Suite, Broken Access Control, Injection, Vulnerable and Outdated Components, CSRF, IDOR, SQL Inejction, NoSQL Manipulation</p>

            <h3>UI State Replication: A Zero-Downtime Patching Solution</h3>
            <p>This project addresses the downsides of software patching downtime. The approach, designed to run locally on endpoint devices to avoiding high costs of LLMs, captures user actions and replays them on a newly patched VM in real-time. The program also validates progress and realigns when non-deterministic elements are introduced. This work provides a scalable, privacy-preserving, and accessible solution for enterprise endpoint security updates.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies and Skills:</strong> Python, pywinauto, UI State Representation, Search Algorithms, Data Serialization and Logging, Error Handling</p>

            <h3>Street Heat: Urban Heat Monitoring in Andalusia</h3>
            <p>Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) intensify climate-related challenges in densely populated regions like Andalusia, Spain. This study addresses previous data collection gaps by developing a low-cost, Arduino-based portable device that measures environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. Informed by local surveys and interviews, the device, the mobile app, and its accompanying website enable real-time data visualization of UHIs to promote research collaboration around the world and raise awareness of UHI effects on human health and the environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Next.js, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Leaflet for creating maps, Google Firebase </p>

            <h3>Student Assistant (SA) Management System</h3>
            <p>This application allows students to create detailed profiles, listing their academic history and courses they have previously been an SA for. They can then browse and apply for open SA positions. Professors use the platform to post positions for their course sections, setting specific requirements (like minimum GPA), and then review the student applications to make their selections. The system uses Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication. </p>
